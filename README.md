# Taproom-React

#### A brief program description

This is a copy/update of the Taproom project done in React.js.

#### By _**Ted Leary**_

## Description

This app will allow the user to view a list of the taproom's kegs, sell pints from those kegs as well as add new kegs and edit existing ones.

### React vs Angular

I have definitely found React's data-flow structure to be a lot more forgiving than Angular's. Passing props just seems simpler, more intuitive and less verbose. Everything also feels a lot more contained, especially in that when you're working on a single component, basically everything pertaining to that component is right in front of you. There's no tabbing back and forth between template and js files.
