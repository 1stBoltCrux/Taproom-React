### Notes:

* I ended up adding an extra component I hadn't planned on. Deciding exactly HOW modular to make things can be a little bit of a challenge. I probably should have made a generic keg-form component to be populated in both my edit and add keg sections.

* Getting CSS Modules going halfway through the project meant refactoring a ton of css into modules syntax which was a pain. I had been relying on the un-scoped CSS for a few components so those needed a more extensive re-write.
